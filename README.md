# H.A.R.E. Mars Rover: Location Finder and TortOS Upgrade üöÄ

Welcome to the H.A.R.E. Mars Rover project, where innovation meets exploration! We've ventured beyond the Earth's limits to bring you our Location Finder and the TortOS Upgrade, two groundbreaking feats of technology.

## Summary

‚Ä¢Implemented a Path finder for the H.A.R.E Mars Rover by creating a wellformedness function with a Path extender in Haskell
and appended it by creating a rotating function that simulates the effect of the rotation of the hard disk to copy the elements
to a Floppy disk using Haskell Constructors and then implemented a challenging encoding scheme to make sure that disk
remains decodable under rotations.

‚Ä¢ Followed it by writing a monadic code using State, Maybe, custom monads and functors to divide the File into Chunks and
allocting each chunk to a unique track number captivatingly followed by writing a monadic code to move the track to a given
number with further facilitating a challenging loading and saving File system functions on a floppy disk.

‚Ä¢ Completed the task by implementing a humongous testing suite using property based testing and QuickCheck for Monadic Testing.

## üåç Explore the Red Planet

At **H.A.R.E. (Haskell Advanced Robotics Exploration)**, we've harnessed the power of Haskell to navigate the Martian terrain with unmatched precision. Our Location Finder calculates optimal paths, adhering to Mars' unique challenges and constraints.

## ü§ñ The TortOS Upgrade

We've revolutionized the rover's operating system, TortOS. Now, our rover operates flawlessly on Mars' challenging landscape. We've conquered the spinning disk dilemma, optimized file storage, and reimagined the file system hierarchy. Efficiency is our mantra.

## üöÄ Get Started

cd Location-finder-and-TortOS-Upgrade-for-H.A.R.E-Mars-Rover
```

## üå† Future Innovations

Our journey doesn't end here. We're committed to enhancing our rover's capabilities. Future upgrades may include AI-driven decision-making, advanced data analysis, and even more efficient disk management. The Red Planet holds endless possibilities.
