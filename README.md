# Location-finder-and-TortOS-Upgrade-for-H.A.R.E-Mars-Rover

Implemented a Path finder and extender for the H.A.R.E Mars Rover with a rotation function to simulate the effect of rotation of the hard disk. Then used Monads in Haskell to divide file into chunks and allocating a unique number and then writing the code to move the track to a number, all for saving and loading file system to floppy disks.
