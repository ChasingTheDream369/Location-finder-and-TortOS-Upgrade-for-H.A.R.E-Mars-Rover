# Location-finder-and-TortOS-Upgrade-for-H.A.R.E-Mars-Rover

•Implemented a Path finder for the H.A.R.E Mars Rover by creating a wellformedness function with a Path extender in Haskell
and appended it by creating a rotating function that simulates the effect of the rotation of the hard disk to copy the elements
to a Floppy disk using Haskell Constructors and then implemented a challenging encoding scheme to make sure that disk
remains decodable under rotations.

• Followed it by writing a monadic code using State, Maybe, custom monads and functors to divide the File into Chunks and
allocting each chunk to a unique track number captivatingly followed by writing a monadic code to move the track to a given
number with further facilitating a challenging loading and saving File system functions on a floppy disk.

• Completed the task by implementing a humongous testing suite using property based testing and QuickCheck for Monadic Testing.
